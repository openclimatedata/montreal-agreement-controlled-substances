Footnotes:

*Annex A*

> These ozone depleting potentials are estimates based on existing knowledge and will be reviewed and revised periodically.

*Annex B*

C2H3Cl3:
> This formula does not refer to 1,1,2-trichloroethane.

*Annex C*
> Where a range of ODPs is indicated, the highest value in that range shall be used for the purposes of the Protocol. The ODPs
listed as a single value have been determined from calculations based on laboratory measurements. Those listed as a range
are based on estimates and are less certain. The range pertains to an isomeric group. The upper value is the estimate of the
ODP of the isomer with the highest ODP, and the lower value is the estimate of the ODP of the isomer with the lowest ODP.

> For substances for which no GWP is indicated, the default value 0 applies until a GWP value is included by means of the
procedure foreseen in paragraph 9 (a) (ii) of Article 2.

For some substances:
> Identifies the most commercially viable substances with ODP values listed against them to be used for the purposes of
the Protocol
